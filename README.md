# Sonic VS Darkness T.N.R. "Decompiled"

A "Decompilation" of Sonic VS Darkness, designed for use with GameMaker 8.2, but can be used with 8.1 if the custom extensions are imported. (The fact that it uses GM8.2 Extensions instead of outdated ones and removes the Memory Kit extension (Snake oil.) should give better performance)

The original game can be found [here](https://nefault1st.wordpress.com/downloads/sonic-vs-darkness-true-nightmare-revived/).

## Status
The decomp works for the most part, but there are some parts that need fixing, such as controller support. I'd say its about 97% complete.
